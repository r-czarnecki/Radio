# Computer networks - Radio

This project was created as part of the University of Warsaw's Computer networks course.

The repository contains a program that allows a user to receive internet radio audio using ICY protocol. It can also work as a proxy in order to distribute the received data using UDP.

There also is a `radio-client` program, that detects all radio proxies and allows a user to select a desired radio and receive data from it.

The exact description of the task (in Polish) can be found in the [task.pdf](task.pdf) file.
